Here you can find the results of various runs of the kernels contained in `exchange_dt.h`. The `Makefile` submits the `run.pbs` job on an increasing number of nodes in `[1, 7]`. The `run.pbs` job loads the appropriate modules (either gcc 6.4 and openmpi 3.0.1, or intel's compiler and mpi implementation, both version 2021.2.0), and then runs the code two times: first with the `GatherBcast` kernel, then with the `AllReduce` kernel. At the end of each run, the minimum average elapsed time is written in a text file named `scaling-N.txt`, where `N` is the number of nodes the job run on. If you look in those text files, you will see four elapsed times: the first two were produced using gcc and openmpi, the second two were produced using intel's products. The first one and the third one refer to the `GatherBcast` kernel. The second one and fourth one refer to the `AllReduce` kernel. The version of the code used is the one at commit `ff9211e60aa845a140d8c0a02cb2597666e9f42f`.
